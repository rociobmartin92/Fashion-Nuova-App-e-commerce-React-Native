# FashionNuova-ReactNative
Mobile App for looking at and buying fashion clothes and accessories ..
I am pretty much enjoying building this app. 
The authentication and the storage was made with AWS

You can take a look at my app through these screens or instead you can run this app in your local simulator. Download the zip code and then run "yarn start" in your terminal. Also, you can run my app in Expo Go
